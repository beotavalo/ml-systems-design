# Machine Learning Systems Design 🚀

Designing machine learning systems is more than just building models—it's about creating deployable, reliable, and scalable solutions that meet real-world needs. This repository explores the art and science of Machine Learning Systems Design, where algorithms are only one piece of the puzzle. The real challenge lies in orchestrating data, infrastructure, and human-centric considerations to build systems that deliver long-term value.

In today’s fast-paced landscape, the stakes are high:

    Data distributions shift 🌍
    Business requirements evolve 📈
    Tooling rapidly innovates 🛠️

Without a well-thought-out design, even the best algorithms can quickly become obsolete. This repository focuses on bridging the gap between technical robustness and practical impact.
What You’ll Learn 🧠

This repository covers essential topics to equip you with the skills needed to design effective ML systems:

    Stakeholder objectives: Understanding who benefits from the system and how.
    Data management & engineering: Building solid data pipelines.
    Feature engineering & model training: Optimizing what goes into the algorithms.
    Scalability & monitoring: Ensuring systems grow with your needs and stay relevant.
    Privacy, fairness & security: Addressing ethical and safety challenges.
    Team structures & business metrics: Making ML work within organizational frameworks.

Whether tackling a new ML project or improving an existing one, this guide will help you navigate trade-offs, align objectives, and future-proof your system.
